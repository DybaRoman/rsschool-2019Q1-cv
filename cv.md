# Resume

**Name:** *Roman Dyba*

**Contacts:** *dybaroman@gmail.com*


**Summary:** I am 29 years old. Until recently, i worked as a math teacher. At some point it seemed to me that this path leads to the wrong direction. So i decided to change the situation and chose the profession of front-end developer, based on my education and my abilities. And i have everything i need to master it:   
* a desire to gain knowledge and skills (from any sources, even illegal ones, :wink: joke)
* free time (for mastering a new profession i refused to work full-time)
* habit of self-education (the main thing that a teacher is taught  is  *to learn*)


**Skills:** basic skills in *HTML&CSS* (https://www.codecademy.com/users/romansmaga1010542582/achievements     https://htmlacademy.ru/profile/id999165/achievements)*, JavaScript, Git*. 


**Aducation:** Francisk Scorina Gomel State University. Faculty of Mathematics and Programming Thechnologies.


**English level:** When it comes to reading or listening to English, i show B1 or even better. But when I need to say something, my level is A1. So total on average i have A2 :confused:. Well, without jokes, my level is between A1 and A2.
