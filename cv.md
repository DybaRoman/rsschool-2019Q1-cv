**Summary:** I am 29 years old. Until recently, i worked as a math teacher. At some point it seemed to me that this path leads to the wrong direction.

 - a desire to gain knowledge and skills (from any sources, even illegal ones, joke)

 - free time (for mastering a new profession i refused to work full-time)

 - habit of self-education (the main thing that a teacher is taught  is  *to learn*)


**Skills:** basic skills in *HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git*. 


**Aducation:** Francisk Scorina Gomel State University. Faculty of Mathematics and Programming Thechnologies.
